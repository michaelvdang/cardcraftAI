OVERVIEW:
Stripe API webhook:
Data flow:
- UI: Customer (logged in) creates checkout session by clicking on a purchase button, passing in priceId, email, userId 
  - priceId: to create session purchasing this item
  - email: to create a stripe customerId if it doesn't aleady exists in firestore 
  - userId: to look up customerId in firestore to keep stripe clean 
- Server: 
  - check if user exists in firestore, create if not 
  - check if user has stripe_customer_id field 
    - if yes, retrieve stripe_customer_id
    - if no, create new stripe customer, get stripe_customer_id
  - create checkout session like in the file, use the stripe_customer_id to pre-populate customer details in the checkout page 
  - DONE -> user is pushed to checkout page to finish
  - (user finishes checkout and pay) -> user is pushed to /results?session_id=<session_id>
  - hook in /results will wait and listen for update from server 
  - if all goes smooth, server will send event to /results to update the user object in app to new subscriptionTier
  - DONE
